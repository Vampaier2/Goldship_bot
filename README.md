Discord Bot because people like to try and kick other people from server. So why not spice things up :3



Because i'm using manjaro i had to install a Python Virtual Environment.
`sudo pacman -S python-virtualenv`

Create a virtual environment:
`python -m venv venv`

Activate it:
`source venv/bin/activate`

Install from requirements.txt
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
